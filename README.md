# OnJava-Tools
Python tools for building the *On Java* book
============================================

- Published here for those interested in creating an alternate build system that generates Gradle files instead of Ant Files.

- This is what I'm currently using, and updating. I'm not looking for pull requests.

- If you're interested in working on the gradle-build project, that will be a separate repo (linked here when it exists).

- I will continue to use this repository (generating Ant files) until such time as a gradle-build system is working, 
at which time I'll experiment with that and decide whether I can switch to it.

- Thanks for your help, those of you that requested this!

How to set up to successfully generate the "Ant" build files for *On Java*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install Python 3.5
2. Create a directory `on-java` on the same level as this one (`OnJava-Tools`).
